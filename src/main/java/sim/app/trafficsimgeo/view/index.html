<p>A poor traffic planning can bring with it countless negative effects such as collapse, traffic jams and accidents. To
    avoid this situation it is useful, before applying transitÂ´s configurations, to know the impact they will bring. In
    this way you can assess, with more confidence, if the configuration will be functional or not. Currently, process
    simulation is a solution to obtain such information. In dependency of the type of simulation, the results will be
    more or less close to reality. The agents-based simulation provides benefit in terms of simulations of road
    networks.</p>
<p>This paper describes the process of developing an agent-based simulation tool that contributes to the process of
    configuring traffic controllers. The development of this tool is based on previous technologies and experiences in
    order to achieve a result adjusted to the real needs and capabilities. The result is a GIS tool for agent-based
    simulation using the MASON framework.</p>
<p>With the development of this tool, analysts and traffic engineers have a tool that provides them with information
    that helps them analyze and make decisions regarding the problems related to the configuration of traffic
    controllers.</p>
